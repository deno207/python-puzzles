# Structure

The book is split into two main sections, challenge puzzles and fun puzzles.

Challenge puzzles make up the main contents of the book and range in difficulty from easy to hard.  
This section has 50 main puzzles with a few extra bonus puzzles.

Fun puzzles are more creative and often focus on using various python libraries.  
This section has 5 puzzles.

My soultions to each of the puzzles will be organised by the type of puzzles and
then the puzzle number or name. I will also include unit tests with each soultion
instead of manually testing each soultion.

Some puzzles include starter code, which is designed to allow the solver to
focus on the puzzle instead of design concerns. When included, this code will
be clearly marked as provided. The puzzles also provide the function signitures
for the main function of each puzzle.
